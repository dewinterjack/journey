## Workplace

I want to start building some projects of my own now that I have submitted the Pets application. It really gave me some motivation and confidence as I was building it.

Tools:

VS Code

* Task runner
* intellisense

Dev Ops - automate everything

I'm very interested in organisation and building better system.
