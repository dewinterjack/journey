## ðŸš© Week 3  ðŸš©

---

Only a 3 day week for me. We had the bank holiday and I have my interview on Thursday.

Challenge:

Sinatra Web Application / Pokemon Battle Site

Reflection:

**Tuesday 3rd April  **_Pair: Daniel Tooke_

_8/10 _

Today didn't start so well, I was exhausted after doing the project for Google so I didn't get in until 12:30.

I have done HTML in the past so it wasn't difficult to get up to speed.

Daniel was great to work with, as there was a lot of reading we spent some time doing that but we also worked well together.

We're currently just learning about Sinatra but I believe we will be moving on to building a Pokemon Battle web app. I love Pokemon so I'm excited to start building that. I want to be working on the challenges at home but as I have the interview on Thursday I need to work on my Java and generally preparing for that.

I will write an article for prep on the interview: Site Reliabiliity, Java \(useful functions\), algorithms
