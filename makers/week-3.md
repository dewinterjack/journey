Reflection:

**Tuesday 3rd April  **_Pair: Daniel Tooke_

_8/10 _

Today didn't start so well, I was exhausted after doing the project for Google so I didn't get in until 12:30.

I have done HTML in the past so it wasn't difficult to get up to speed.

Daniel was great to work with, as there was a lot of reading we spent some time doing that but we also worked well together.
