# My Developer Journey

In March I started my journey in becoming a full time developer. It was a big step for me, after being interested for a while, I'm now enrolled in [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) and looking to learn as much as I can about the industry. I'm loving it so far.  ðŸ¤©

I want to keep track of my progress, so I'm writing this GitBook. Anyone reading is welcome, I'm happy to share, please feel free to get in contact,

Jack.

GitBooks can store my documentation and journey through my projects.

## **Past Projects**

#### Makers

**Weekly Challenges:**

1. [Boris Bike ](https://github.com/dewinterjack/boris_week1)
2. [Oyster Card](https://github.com/dewinterjack/oyster_week2)

I am focusing on becoming an ace developer. A big thing for me is having a consistent workflow.

GitBook is great for sharing results, however I need something for as I'm working. Currently Trello is working well.

## Future Projects

* GitBook plugin
* [Node app](/node-app.md)
* Android app that can write to GitBook \(or just be able to write markdown and sync with computer\)
* App that backs up all snapchat memories to a folder \(bot\)
* bash \(zsh\) script for creating repo &gt; adding readme etc. ask for type and do bundle or create index.js etc

Start structuring the book a bit more.
