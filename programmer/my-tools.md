Ruby gem:

Set up spec files. When I start a project, I'll run a gem, tell it the features a user will use. Also the features of the program \(anything that does anything\). Gem will create spec files with describe/feature and it/scenario. You first type in the thing you are describing, you can list different describes, then you put in the its for it.
