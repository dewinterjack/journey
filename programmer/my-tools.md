Ruby gem:

Set up spec files. When I start a project, I'll run a gem, tell it the features a user will use. Also the features of the program \(anything that does anything\). Gem will create spec files with describe/feature and it/scenario. You first type in the thing you are describing, you can list different describes, then you put in the its for it. Option to add a comment so it makes sense when you open the file. Comments start with project\_tests

1. Check if spec init has been run.
2. Run if it hasn't 

Could be built up into a project planner.
