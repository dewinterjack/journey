I started building this node package that run's scripts and deals with inputs and outputs like files and arguments, directories managament etc. I only really built a skeleton but to be honest I have no idea where to go with it. I'm going to need to do a bit of research.

I would like to be able to run ruby projects off this application if it's possible.
