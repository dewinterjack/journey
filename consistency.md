## Consistency

I'm going to keep track of certain consistencies that I keep over my career. They will help me refine my skills and speed up my progression.

**Progression Documentation**

Folder structure for a project. File (top-level) is a readme. It will link to progression docs that are my thought process and demonstration as I am building it. 

I could also have seperate or extensions to the readme for detailing parts of the code but not my thought process.
