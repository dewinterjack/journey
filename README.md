# My Developer Journey

In Mrch I started my journey in becoming a full time developer. It was a big step for me, after being interested for a while, I'm now enrolled in [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) and looking to learn as much as I can about the industry. I'm loving it so far.  🤩

I want to keep track of my progress, so I'm writing this GitBook. Anyone reading is welcome, I'm happy to share, please feel free to get in contact,

Jack.

GitBooks can store my documentation and journey through my projects.

## **Past Projects**

#### Makers

**Weekly Challenges:**

1. [Boris Bike ](https://github.com/dewinterjack/boris_week1)
2. [Oyster Card](https://github.com/dewinterjack/oyster_week2)

I am focusing on becoming an ace developer. A big thing for me is having a consistent workflow.

GitBook is great for sharing results, however I need something for as I'm working. Currently Trello is working well.
