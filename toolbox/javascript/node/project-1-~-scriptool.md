I started building this node package that run's scripts and deals with inputs and outputs like files and arguments, directories managament etc. I only really built a skeleton but to be honest I have no idea where to go with it. I'm going to need to do a bit of research.

I would like to be able to run ruby projects off this application if it's possible. It could manage the ~ dir.

To be realistic, as I haven't built any node code before, I'm going to start with something simple.

Ok, here goes:

Really simple idea, but I know how I can get it more interesting. Not sure exactly how useful it will be but who cares right now!

I want to build this small idea into a package, and once a feature is implemented, I will move on to the next. I'm not going to do everything at once. The app will simple act as a storage container for one piece of data. It will accept a value and will produce the value. I'll progress it in stages.

**Scrip ~ Store an item of data.**
