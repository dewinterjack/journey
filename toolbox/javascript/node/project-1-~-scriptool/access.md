```bash
package name: (access)
version: (1.0.0)
description: Holds an item in a text file.
```

#### access has been created.

I have installed the **Chai **testing framework, hopefully that will help me out a bit. I'm going to be using the `expect` style, it seems similar to Ruby's rspec.

Here we have the repo:

Let's imagine I'm using the package access, that hasn't been written yet.

The 2 features defined were:

1. Can recieve a single piece of data

2. Can return the same data

A text file would be used for storage.
