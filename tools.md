I'm going to start building my own tools.

Starting with the basics, working my way up to scriptool, for managing my scripts and reporting on stats etc.

1. Save websites as bookmarks.
2. Happy list - one point each, write something you're happy about. Then list them
3. Close all chrome tabs
4. Check local weather
