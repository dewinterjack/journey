People can customize their own tree, how it looks, displayed etc. Present it in a certain way for people.

Collaborative trees, people may need to vote for how it looks or what happens etc.

One person can add someone to a tree, root needs to confirm. Can provide proof as to why they are family.

Could work like git. pull requests/branches. forks. Multiple versions of a tree that people can contribute to, could enforse rules such as needing proof.
